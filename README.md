This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Type 2 diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. Five supervised models—Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—were developed and evaluated using Orange Data Mining.

Results show that Logistic Regression achieved the highest overall accuracy, while Neural Networks performed best in terms of AUC. Feature importance and explainability analysis highlight glucose levels and BMI as the strongest predictors of diabetes.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and originally provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.
